# What is `Comunicazione Aziendale`

> A school project valid for graduation, commissioned by a small IT company.

# ðŸ“¢ The request

We were asked to develop a web app that allowes employees to aknowledge their specific events and meetings.

Imagine having a big company, in the common spaces there will be big touch screen monitors displaying our app, employees can see which events are relevant to them.

Employees also recive emails cointaining event details.

There should be some people in the company with the ability to sign in and acces the Admin Panel, which allows them to pubblish new posts/events.
